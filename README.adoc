= Admin Designer Toolkit


The aim of this application is to make it easier to customize http://github.com/adminfaces/admin-theme[AdminFaces theme^].


== How it works

. First start the application by running the command:
+
----
mvn wildfly-swarm:run
----
. Second edit any less file in directory `src/main/resources/less`
. Finally compile the application using:
----
 mvn compile
----

The changes made to less files should be visible in running application `http://localhost:8080/showcase`

NOTE: There is no need to stop and run the application again.
